# kotlin-android-calculator
I created simple Calculator, written in Kotlin, using MVP and seperate class for Math Operations. App can be downloaded from Google Play Store.
All the functions work correctly. I've used Kotlin Long numbers for retrieving results, but I set the limit on the screen to 20 numbers. Decimals 
are rounded up after 10 digits, and when zeros are trailing, those are cut as well. 
Generally app was created for educational reasons.
Main activity is focusing only on responding on events that are happening because of user, Presenter is having all those responses and make the logic of the app.
In the Contract you can find functions that can be used across.
